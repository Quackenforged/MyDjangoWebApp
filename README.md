# Overview

App for creating a blog

I chose this project in order to learn how to use javascript in a real world application

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

I created a web app that allows for creation of an account, log in to that account, and creation of blog posts

# Development Environment

I use VScode to write everything for this and used Chrome to test it

I used Javascript and Node
